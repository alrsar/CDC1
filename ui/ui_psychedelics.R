            In the context of the observed increasing trends in psychedelic use, 
            the potential expansion of access to psychedelic substances for therapeutic purposes,
            and increasing calls for decriminalization of possession of psychedelic and 
            other substances, it is prudent to plan for ongoing surveillance of harms 
            associated for common psychedelic substances.

            number of calls and factors associated with calls, in order to provide information
